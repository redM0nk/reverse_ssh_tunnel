Using autossh and reverse ssh tunneling to enable accessing your machines even if they are NAT'd or behind firewalls - automatically.

How to use this:

(Note this script assumes you are using Ubuntu)

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redM0nk/reverse_ssh_tunnel/webrtc_port/setup_reverse_tunnel.sh
chmod +x ./setup_reverse_tunnel.sh
sudo ./setup_reverse_tunnel.sh

Why to use this:

You Want to forward a port from some device somewhere, whether it's behind a firewall or not, to make it accessable on a given computer all the time.

EDIT:
I forked this so I could add the ability to select which port gets forwarded.
This script is not mine, and I take no resposiblity for it.

Note: This works great for some quick hacking or testing, but not usually for a long term solution. If you can you should look at setting up openvpn. There are some great guides a quick google search away, besides if you can handle this script, you probably have the know how to configureOpenVPN.
